- **International Trade and Economic Growth in the Era of Geoeconomic Fragmentation.** (w/ Dominick Salvatore). Submitted, Under Review. <br>
*Abstract:* This paper studies the relationship between international trade and economic growth during the era of geoeconomic fragmentation (2017–2023), using a simultaneous equations model estimated through the full information maximum likelihood method. The study covers 132 countries (30 advanced and 102 developing) and also analyzes trade-growth dynamics separately for large and small economies. The findings confirm that trade remains a crucial factor for economic growth, but it acts more as a facilitator than a direct driver. In advanced countries, exports positively contribute to capital formation and growth, and industrialization contributes significantly to exports, while capital inflows have a negative effect on fixed capital formation. For developing countries, industrialization significantly boosts exports and in turn economic growth. The study highlights that the rise in protectionism and trade disruptions during the geoeconomic fragmentation period may weaken the positive impact of trade on growth. The results are validated through dynamic simulations, underscoring the need for strategic industrialization and trade partnerships to sustain growth in a fragmented global economy. <br>

- **The Impact of Tariffs on Inflation and Household Budgets Across Income Levels in the US.** (w/ Erick W. Rengifo). <br>
*Abstract:* This paper investigates the impact of tariffs on inflation and household budgets across income levels in the United States, focusing on food and beverages—necessity goods with potentially stronger negative impact on low- and middle-income households. Using WTO trade data, we identify the U.S.’s top trading partners and the key imported goods, then examine how tariff-induced price increases in food and beverages affect household expenditure patterns. We employ the Consumer Expenditure Survey to analyze income, expenditure, and spending behavior across different income quintiles. Our findings reveal that the lower-middle income quintile HHs are disproportionately affected, as they allocate a substantial portion of their disposable income to food and beverages and are already operating under financial strain. We apply a calibration exercise using a CES utility function to model how these households adjust their expenditures in response to higher food prices, highlighting a significant loss in utility due to their limited ability to reduce spending in other areas. This paper underscores the economic vulnerability of lower- and middle-income households to tariff-induced inflation and calls for targeted policy interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of trade policy on household welfare.

- **Bond ETF Performance During the COVID-19 Crisis.** (w/ Jay Surti). <br>
*Abstract:* Arbitrage activity by large banks (called APs) is vital to ensuring the efficiency and stability of ETF performance. Exploiting the availability of data for the period of the Covid-19-associated market instability, we analyze and contrast APs’ arbitrage activity in normal versus stressed market conditions for a representative database of passive, fixed-income ETFs. We find that APs trade ETF shares and bonds in a manner consistent with the arbitrage incentives predicted by theory, in normal times, for corporate bond ETFs, but not for broad market ETFs. For corporate bond ETFs, these incentives were dented significantly during March-April 2020, resulting in persistent, larger discounts-to-NAV of ETF share prices until the Fed’s policy interventions turned the tide. APs’ incentives to manage bond inflow shocks during this period constitute a key factor generating countervailing incentives, interacting with the liquidity of corporate bond ETFs’ asset portfolios. Our results add to emerging empirical evidence that APs do not trade at a scale necessary to quickly close out price-NAV differentials and also appear to trade in a direction that exacerbates share price discounts-to-NAV during times of stress. We find no significant differences between ETFs that are primarily held by institutional versus retail investors. <br>
